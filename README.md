 E-commerce Website (Beginner Level)

A basic e-commerce website layout built using HTML and CSS. This project is part of my learning journey and focuses on building structured layouts, styling product cards, and designing a simple user interface without JavaScript functionality. The project is still in progress and will be improved over time.
